- 👋 Hi, I’m @UnderTheirThumb
- 👀 I’m interested in ...savvy individuals to help me solve the person(s) responsible for invading every aspect of my life. 
- 🌱 I possess literally no tech experience or knowledge it's probably similar to discussing coding with your grandma. 
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on ...
- 📫 How to reach me... please understand that I assume that I have no privacy ever..I have received photos taken of me from my own phone..audio recordings, and some not taken from my phone..such as videos (and photos)of me using the bathroom, my bf and I sleeping,etc. My social media accounts have been compromised then taken over. Every email address (including my Gmail that I have had since Gmail was invite only..probably about 2004.) And every recovery email, passwords changed, phone service suspended and one time terminated and the end result was losing my recovery phone number, there is much more..this is the condensed 
If anyone can help my email is sugarsbabygirl79@gmail.com 
Please. 
I have photos I have come across, they seem like maybe they have info if I manipulate the contrast but I never can quite get it right..I will try to attach some photos for example. Some are untouched some are the result of my adjustments..
